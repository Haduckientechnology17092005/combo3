            <p>A classic, mouthwatering sandwich made with a juicy, grilled beef patty nestled between two soft buns. The burger is layered with fresh lettuce, ripe tomatoes, crunchy pickles, and a slice of cheese that melts perfectly over the patty. Often topped with condiments like ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise, the flavors blend together to create a satisfying bite. Additional toppings such as onions, bacon, or avocado can enhance the richness, making this popular dish a versatile and satisfying meal for any time of the day. Served hot, often accompanied by a side of fries or a salad.</p>
